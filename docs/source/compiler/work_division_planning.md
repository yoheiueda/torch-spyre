# Work Division Planning

This document describes the multi-dimensional parallelization planning in
Torch-Spyre, which determines how computational work is distributed across
multiple cores for parallel execution.

## Motivation

Spyre provides multiple processing cores that can execute operations in
parallel. To maximize performance, the compiler must decide how to divide
tensor operations across these cores. The challenges are to:

1. Maximize parallelism by using as many cores as possible
2. Ensure balanced workloads across all cores
3. Respect hardware memory constraints per core
4. Maintain correctness by respecting operation semantics

The work division planning phase analyzes each operation in the computation
graph and determines a parallelization strategy based on the operation type,
tensor dimensions, device layouts, and available hardware resources. In the
future we wish to combine it with LX scratchpad optimization and consider
optimal work divisions beyond a single operation.

## Iteration Space

Each operation has an _iteration space_: the set of loop variables and their
ranges that together enumerate all output elements (for pointwise ops) or all
input elements (for reductions). For example, a 2D pointwise op over an output
of shape `[M, N]` has iteration space `{c0: M, c1: N}`.

Stick variables — iteration variables whose range maps to the innermost (stick)
device dimension of some tensor — are converted from element counts to stick
counts before planning. This ensures core splits always land on stick
boundaries, since each core must receive a whole number of sticks. When
multiple tensors of different dtypes share a stick variable, the conversion
uses the largest `elems_per_stick` across those tensors (conservative: fewer
sticks → smaller adjusted size → fewer cores assigned to that dimension).

## Hardware Memory Span Constraint

Each Spyre core has a 256 MB limit on the memory span it can access. The
_per-core span_ for a tensor is the contiguous range of device memory (in
sticks) that a single core must read or write, given a particular split
assignment. It is determined by the outermost device dimension that a core
touches: `per_core_size * stride`, where `per_core_size` is the number of
positions along that dimension each core covers.

If splitting is not applied, a large tensor may violate this limit. The
planner detects violations and computes the minimum number of slices required
on the responsible iteration variables to bring each tensor's span within the
limit.

For stick variables, valid slice counts are restricted to divisors of the
stick count, so each core always receives a whole number of sticks. If the
same iteration variable is a stick variable for one tensor and a span variable
for another, and no valid slice count satisfies both constraints simultaneously,
the compiler raises an error at compile time.

## Planning Algorithm

Work division is implemented as two sequential compiler passes over all
operations, both in
[work_division.py](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/_inductor/work_division.py)
and called from `CustomPreSchedulingPasses` in
[passes.py](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/_inductor/passes.py).

### Pass 1 — Span Reduction (`span_reduction`)

Mandatory. Runs first over all operations.

For each operation, `span_reduction_pass` computes the minimum splits required
to keep every tensor's per-core memory span within 256 MB (`must_split_vars`).

`must_split_vars` processes tensors one at a time. For each tensor whose
per-core span exceeds 256 MB, it iterates over device dimensions outer to inner
and searches for the best split combination (Cartesian product of valid
divisors for the variables contributing to that dimension) that satisfies the
hardware limit. The search applies a two-tier selection: among combinations
whose total core count does not exceed `max_cores`, prefer the one with the
**largest span that still fits within the limit** (fewest cores used); if no
combination brings the span within the limit, fall back to the one with the
**smallest span** (most progress). Previously committed splits are carried
forward as lower bounds, narrowing the search for subsequent tensors.

The resulting minimum splits are written to `op.op_it_space_splits` via
`apply_splits`. If no span violation exists, `op_it_space_splits` is left
unset.

### Pass 2 — Work Distribution (`work_distribution`)

Optional (future: graph-aware). Runs after Pass 1 has completed for all
operations.

For each operation, `work_distribution_pass`:

1. Recovers the splits committed by Pass 1 by reading `op.op_it_space_splits`
   via `apply_splits_from_index_coeff`. This uses the same coeff-keyed encoding
   that codegen uses, ensuring stability across compiler passes even as sympy
   symbols are renamed.
2. Ranks the remaining dimensions (those not already committed by Pass 1) for
   additional core assignment (`prioritize_dimensions`): output dimensions
   first by decreasing stick-adjusted size, reduction dimensions last. At most
   one reduction dimension is eligible for splitting — the one that maximises
   `core_split(size, remaining_cores)` after output dimensions have absorbed
   their share of cores. If Pass 1 already committed a reduction split, no
   further reduction dimensions are eligible.
3. Distributes all `max_cores` across committed and priority dimensions
   (`multi_dim_iteration_space_split`): first applies the committed splits as
   minimum requirements, then greedily assigns the largest valid divisor of
   each remaining dimension to the leftover core budget.

The final splits overwrite `op.op_it_space_splits`. The attribute is a `dict`
keyed by the index coefficients of the buffer's read and write index
expressions (computed by `splits_by_index_coeff` in
[pass_utils.py](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/_inductor/pass_utils.py)),
with each coefficient mapping to its slice count. Downstream passes can recover
an iteration-variable view by calling
`apply_splits_from_index_coeff(splits, write_index, read_index, it_space)`.

:::{note}
**Two distinct memory limits.** The 256 MB span limit in step 1 is a per-core addressable device memory constraint, set by how much DDR each core can reach in its address space. It is not the same thing as the 2 MB on-core LX scratchpad. Scratchpad allocation is a separate decision, made by the `scratchpad_planning` pass (see [scratchpad.py](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/_inductor/scratchpad.py)).

## Operation-Specific Strategies

### Pointwise Operations

The iteration space is that of the output tensor. All output dimensions are
candidates for splitting. There is no reduction dimension. Span-required
splits are computed jointly over all input and output tensors.

### Reduction Operations

Output dimensions are split first, by decreasing size. After output dimensions
have been assigned cores, at most one reduction dimension may also be split: the
one whose size has the most useful divisors for the remaining core budget (i.e.
maximises `core_split(size, remaining_cores)`). If Pass 1 already committed a
reduction split to satisfy the span limit, no further reduction dimension is
split in Pass 2.

Span-required splits may include at most one reduction variable; if more than
one reduction variable must be split to satisfy the 256 MB limit, the compiler
raises an error.

For matrix multiplication the reduction dimension is K. Since all matrix
multiply variants (mm, bmm) have exactly one K dimension, K is treated as any
other reduction dimension: output dimensions (batch, M, N) take priority by
decreasing size, and K is only split when the output dimensions cannot utilise
all available cores.

## Configuration

Work division is controlled by the `SENCORES` environment variable, which
specifies the maximum number of cores available for parallelization. Valid
values range from 1 (no parallelization) to 32 (maximum supported cores).

## Limitations and Future Work

**Current limitations:**

- Dimensions must divide evenly by the slice count (no uneven splits)
- Only `Pointwise` and `Reduction` IR nodes are dispatched for work division;
  `ExternKernel` and `FallbackKernel` nodes are skipped

**Potential future enhancements:**

- Retrieving correct padding instead of simplifying assumption
- Cross-operation optimization considering data reuse and memory hierarchy
- Integration with LX scratchpad memory planning
