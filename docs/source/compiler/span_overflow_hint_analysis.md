# Span-Overflow Hint Analysis

## Background

Spyre kernels must keep each core's memory-address span within the hardware
limit (`MAX_SPAN_BYTES`, normally 256 MiB).  Normal `work_division` splits work
across cores, but some physical layouts still expose a span that is too large
for one core.  When that happens, backend compilation can fail with Work
Division warnings, deeptools mutable-address failures, or immediate/EAR boundary
errors.

`span_overflow_hint_analysis.py` is the compiler-generated version of a user
`spyre_hint`: it detects span-risky `ComputedBuffer` ops and asks existing
coarse tiling to run those ops in smaller output-range tiles.

The planner does not mutate IR directly.  It computes a `SpanOverflowTilePlan`.
The adapter in `coarse_tile.py` converts that plan into the same `DimHint` and
coarse-tile group format used by manual `spyre_hint`.

```text
span_overflow_hint_analysis
  -> coarse_tile.span_overflow_groups
  -> coarse_tile
  -> CountedLoopSchedulerNode
  -> LoopSpec codegen
```

## High-Level Contract

The planner answers this question for one op:

> If Work Division gives this op no useful span reduction, can output-range
> coarse tiling make every relevant output/input span fit under
> `MAX_SPAN_BYTES`?

The important design choice is conservative validation: automatic tiles must be
safe even if Work Division later chooses a different split dimension or cannot
split the span-driving coordinate at all.  Work Division may still improve
parallelism, but correctness must not depend on it.

## Concrete Examples

This section gives examples for the main cases the pass handles.  Shapes are
representative; exact split counts can vary with Spyre physical layout, dtype,
`SENCORES`, and `MAX_SPAN_BYTES`.

### 1. Pointwise Output Span Overflow

Example operation:

```python
def fn(x, y):
    return x + y

x.shape == y.shape == (1, 8195, 256, 64)
```

The output is large enough that one physical output coordinate can span more
than the limit.  The Pointwise path collects an output candidate and emits an
output-range tile, for example:

```text
selected_host_dim = 1
split_count       = 5
```

Conceptually this is equivalent to:

```python
with spyre_hint(num_tiles_per_dim={"H": 5}):
    out = x + y
```

Code flow:

```text
plan_span_overflow_tile
  -> Pointwise branch
  -> _has_indirect_reads(op) == False
  -> _output_span_candidates_from_op
  -> _search_min_cost_tile_plan
  -> _post_tile_layout_for_splits
  -> _remaining_span_candidates_after_tile
  -> SpanOverflowTilePlan(levels=(host_dim=1, split_count=5))
```

### 2. Pointwise With Indirect/Gather Read

Example pattern:

```python
def fn(x, index):
    return x[index] + 1
```

Even if the resulting output layout is large, automatic span-overflow tiling is
skipped because indirect access needs the dedicated indirect-access path.  The
planner returns `None`.

Code flow:

```text
plan_span_overflow_tile
  -> Pointwise branch
  -> _has_indirect_reads(op) == True
  -> return None
```

### 3. Reduction Output Span Overflow

Example operation:

```python
def fn(x):
    return x.sum(dim=-1)

x.shape == (1, 8195, 256, 64)
out.shape == (1, 8195, 256)
```

The reduction output itself can have an unsafe physical span.  The planner uses
the same output-candidate path as Pointwise, but through the Reduction branch.
If a safe output-range tile exists, it emits a normal output-dim plan.

Code flow:

```text
plan_span_overflow_tile
  -> Reduction branch
  -> _has_indirect_reads(op) == False
  -> op.data.ranges is not empty
  -> _output_span_candidates_from_op
  -> _input_span_candidates
  -> _search_min_cost_tile_plan
```

### 4. Reduction Input Span Controlled By Output Dim

Example operation:

```python
def fn(x):
    return x.sum(dim=0)

x.shape   == (2, 20, 16, 64)
out.shape == (20, 16, 64)
```

The output may be smaller than the input, but reading `x` can still span too
much memory.  If the overflowing input physical coordinate is controlled by an
output symbol, such as the output `20` dimension, output-range tiling can reduce
the input span.

A small codegen test uses a patched span limit and checks for:

```text
LoopSpec(
count=sympify('10')
op='sum'
tiled_symbols=[[sympify('c0')]]
```

Code flow:

```text
plan_span_overflow_tile
  -> Reduction branch
  -> _output_span_candidates_from_op
  -> _input_span_candidates
       -> _input_span_infos_controlled_by_output_dims
          -> device coordinate contains output symbol
          -> create input-derived SpanOverflowCandidate
  -> _search_min_cost_tile_plan
```

### 5. BMM / LM-Head Input Span Controlled By Output Dim

Example operation:

```python
def lm_head(x, weight):
    return torch.nn.functional.linear(x, weight)

x.shape      == (2, 64)
weight.shape == (1024, 64)
out.shape    == (2, 1024)
```

Lowering can represent this as a restickify producer followed by a
batch-matmul-style reduction.  The BMM symbol model is:

```text
C[b, m, n] = reduce_k A[b, m, k] * B[b, k, n]
```

Spans controlled by `b`, `m`, or `n` are output-range tileable.  Spans
controlled by `k` are not.  In the LM-head lowering, the restickify producer can
be auto-tiled independently.  The BMM consumer is not automatically fused with
that producer yet, so current codegen coverage checks for a restickify
`LoopSpec` plus a plain BMM consumer:

```text
LoopSpec(
count=sympify('4')
op='ReStickifyOpHBM'
tiled_symbols=[[sympify('c0')]]

op='batchmatmul'
```

Code flow:

```text
plan_span_overflow_tile
  -> Reduction branch
  -> _is_batch_matmul_reduction(op) == True
  -> _bmm_output_symbol_to_dim
       -> verify exactly one reduction-only symbol, k for input-span candidates
  -> _input_span_candidates
  -> _search_min_cost_tile_plan
```

### 6. Multiple Overflowing Host Dims

Example pattern:

```python
x.shape == (4096, 4096, 4096, 64)
out = x + 1
```

More than one physical coordinate can independently exceed the span limit.  The
planner creates candidates for each overflowing host dim, generates legal split
candidates for each dim, and searches combinations.

A multi-level result looks like:

```python
SpanOverflowTilePlan(
    levels=(
        SpanOverflowTileLevel(selected_host_dim=0, split_count=2),
        SpanOverflowTileLevel(selected_host_dim=1, split_count=2),
    ),
)
```

Code flow:

```text
_output_span_candidates_from_op -> candidates for dim 0 and dim 1
_candidate_host_dims            -> order by span pressure
_split_candidates_for_host_dim  -> legal divisors per dim
_iter_split_combos              -> cheapest combos first
_remaining_span_candidates_after_tile -> accept only if all spans are safe
```

### 7. Input Stick-Alignment Rejection

Example pattern:

```text
output dim m is safe to split in the output layout,
but the same m symbol maps to the within-stick dim of a transposed BMM input.
```

The planner rejects the split if it would cut through physical sticks in any
input dependency.  This prevents a plan that is legal for the output tensor but
unsafe for an input tensor.

`_input_stick_alignment_error` checks every input dimension the split symbol
contributes to, not only a dimension it controls alone.  A single input
dimension's coordinate can be jointly controlled by the symbol together with
another symbol (e.g. an interleaved/collapsed physical stride after a view or
transpose) -- checking only dimensions where the symbol is the sole free
symbol would silently skip stick alignment for that dimension entirely.

Both `_post_tile_stick_alignment_error` and `_input_stick_alignment_error`
depend on `_within_stick_host_dim` to identify which host dim is the
within-stick dim for a given layout.  If no host stride exactly matches the
device layout's stride-map entry, `_within_stick_host_dim` returns `None`
rather than guess a fallback dim, and the caller treats that as "cannot
verify, reject the split" -- matching the "skip/reject rather than guess"
discipline used elsewhere in this pass (ambiguous BMM symbol maps return
empty; `_resize_device_layout` raises rather than guess an ambiguous stick
dim by elimination).

Code flow:

```text
_split_candidates_for_host_dim
  -> _post_tile_stick_alignment_error(op.layout, host_dim, split)
       -> _within_stick_host_dim(op.layout)
  -> _input_stick_alignment_error(op, host_dim, split)
       -> map output host dim to output symbol
       -> find every input dim that symbol contributes to
       -> check that input layout's stick dim is not cut, via
          _post_tile_stick_alignment_error -> _within_stick_host_dim
```

### 8. Reduction-Controlled Span: Known Unsupported Case

Example operation:

```python
def fn(x):
    return x.sum(dim=-1)
```

If the only overflowing input coordinate is controlled by the reduction symbol
`k`, output-range tiling cannot fix it.  This pass intentionally skips that
candidate.

Code flow:

```text
_input_span_infos_controlled_by_output_dims
  -> coordinate free symbols include k
  -> k is not in output_symbol_to_dim
  -> reduction_syms is non-empty
  -> continue
```

This is not solved by the current pass.  It needs reduction-range tiling and
partial accumulation.

### 9. Coordinate Jointly Controlled by Two Output Symbols

Example pattern:

```text
device coordinate = floor(h / 2048) + floor(2 * Mod(l, 2048))
```

Some physical layouts interleave two logical dims into one physical stride --
for example a device dimension whose coordinate is a sum of independent terms
in `h` and `l`.  Earlier this was skipped outright because coordinate
discovery only accepted a coordinate driven by exactly one output symbol; that
silently dropped the coordinate from span analysis entirely, so its span was
never checked against `MAX_SPAN_BYTES` even after tiling other dims.

`_coordinate_span_elems` computes a conservative span bound by summing each
free symbol's independent contribution, so a coordinate mixing two or more
*output* symbols can be evaluated like one with a single symbol.  Plain
monotonic terms are checked at endpoints.  Mod-wrapped terms are evaluated at
a wraparound critical point in the full term expression, preserving scale
factors such as `2 * Mod(l, 2048)`.

A per-symbol term can contain more than one `Mod` atom on that same symbol
with different moduli (e.g. two overlapping/interleaved stick strides both
keyed on the same loop variable).  The term is evaluated at every such atom's
own critical point plus both domain endpoints, and the true max/min is taken
across all candidates -- evaluating only at a single critical point derived
from the smallest modulus would risk assuming that modulus's wraparound also
maximizes every other `Mod` term summed alongside it, which is not generally
true.

The critical-point trick itself is only exact when a `Mod`'s argument is the
*bare* symbol.  A coefficient on the argument (e.g. `Mod(3 * h, 64)`) wraps at
different symbol values than `modulus - 1`, and evaluating only at the naive
critical point can silently underestimate the span (confirmed: `Mod(3 * h,
64)` over `h` in `[0, 100)` has a true max of 63 at `h=21`, not the 61 found
by evaluating only at `h=63`).  `_coordinate_span_elems` detects this case and
returns `None` (the same "cannot determine, skip this candidate" signal every
caller already handles) rather than trust an unproven bound.

Discovery accepts a coordinate as long as every free symbol is
output-controlled (still rejecting any coordinate that also involves a
reduction-only symbol) and registers one candidate per contributing host dim,
so the combo search can consider splitting them together.

Code flow:

```text
_output_span_candidates_from_op / _input_span_infos_controlled_by_output_dims
  -> output_syms = symbols in coord that are output-controlled
  -> skip only if some free symbol is reduction-only
  -> split_by_symbol = {sym: split_by_host_dim[dim(sym)] for sym in output_syms}
  -> coord_span_elems = _coordinate_span_elems(coord, dep, split_by_symbol)
  -> one SpanOverflowCandidate/InputSpanInfo per symbol in output_syms
```

## Entry Point

The planner entry point is:

```python
plan = plan_span_overflow_tile(op, max_cores=config.sencores)
```

It returns:

```python
SpanOverflowTilePlan(
    levels=(
        SpanOverflowTileLevel(selected_host_dim=..., split_count=...),
        ...,
    ),
    chunking_infos=(...),
    reason="...",
)
```

or `None` if no automatic span-overflow tiling is needed or supported for that
op.

`span_overflow_groups(graph)` consumes the plan, attaches synthetic `DimHint`s,
and returns groups shaped like user hint groups:

```python
[([op], [(hint_id, split_count, is_reduction_level), ...])]
```

`is_reduction_level` is currently `False` for automatic span-overflow hints;
they tile output ranges, not reduction ranges.

## Scope

The production planner handles:

- `ComputedBuffer` ops with `Pointwise` data;
- `ComputedBuffer` ops with non-scalar `Reduction` data;
- output layout span overflow;
- reduction/BMM input span overflow when the span is controlled by output
  symbols;
- one or more output host dimensions per op, bounded by `_MAX_TILE_DIMS`;
- static `FixedTiledLayout` metadata only.

The planner skips:

- non-`ComputedBuffer` ops;
- non-`FixedTiledLayout` ops, including mutation/copy-back intermediate layouts;
- symbolic/dynamic layout metadata;
- scalar/full reductions where `op.data.ranges` is empty;
- Pointwise or Reduction ops with indirect/gather/scatter-style reads;
- input spans controlled only by reduction symbols.

### Support Matrix

| Case | Supported? | Planner behavior |
|---|---:|---|
| Pointwise output span overflow | Yes | Emit one or more output-range tile levels |
| Pointwise indirect/gather read | No | Return `None`; indirect path owns it |
| Reduction output span overflow | Yes | Emit output-range tile levels if post-tile layout validates |
| Reduction input span controlled by output dim | Yes | Emit tile for the matching output dim |
| Coordinate jointly controlled by 2+ output symbols | Yes | Emit a candidate for each contributing dim |
| Reduction input span controlled by reduction dim | No | Skip candidate; reduction-range tiling is future work |
| BMM input span controlled by `b`, `m`, or `n` | Yes | Emit tile for matching output dim |
| BMM input span controlled by `k` | No | Skip candidate; `k` is reduction-only |
| BMM with ambiguous reduction symbols | No | Return no BMM input candidates |
| Scalar/full reduction | No | Return `None` |
| Symbolic layout metadata | No | Return `None` |
| More than `_MAX_TILE_DIMS` overflowing host dims | No | Raise `Unsupported` |
| No legal exact divisor / stick-safe split | No | Raise `Unsupported` |
| User already supplied `spyre_hint` for op | Manual wins | Auto hint is not added for that op |

## Pointwise Flow

For `Pointwise` ops, `plan_span_overflow_tile` does:

```text
check op/layout eligibility
check _has_indirect_reads(op); skip if true
collect output span candidates
search for cheapest valid tile combination
```

The main output collector is `_output_span_candidates_from_op`.  It prefers
physical address-coordinate analysis:

1. read the output `MemoryDep`;
2. map output iteration symbols to output dimensions;
3. compute physical device coordinates for the output layout;
4. walk non-stick device coordinates;
5. create one `SpanOverflowCandidate` per output symbol that controls a
   coordinate whose span exceeds `MAX_SPAN_BYTES` -- a coordinate jointly
   controlled by several output symbols contributes one candidate per
   contributing dim (see [Coordinate Jointly Controlled by Two Output
   Symbols](#9-coordinate-jointly-controlled-by-two-output-symbols)).

If output write-dep or symbol-coordinate analysis is unavailable, the planner
returns no output candidates instead of falling back to stride-map guessing.
This keeps span planning on the same `MemoryDep` address-math model used by
work division while avoiding compile failures for ops that may not need
automatic tiling.

## Reduction Flow

For `Reduction` ops, `plan_span_overflow_tile` does:

```text
check op/layout eligibility
check _has_indirect_reads(op); skip if true
skip scalar reductions
collect output span candidates
collect input span candidates controlled by output dims
search for cheapest valid tile combination
```

A reduction can overflow in two ways:

1. the output layout itself is too large; or
2. the output is small, but reading an input spans too much physical memory.

For input reads, `_input_span_infos_controlled_by_output_dims` walks the input
physical device coordinates.  For each non-stick coordinate it separates free
symbols into:

- output symbols: symbols present in `_output_symbol_to_dim(op)`;
- reduction symbols: symbols not present in that output map.

If every free symbol in a coordinate is output-controlled, output-range coarse
tiling can reduce that input span, so the planner creates one input-derived
candidate per contributing output symbol -- one for a coordinate driven by a
single output dim, or several for a coordinate that jointly mixes multiple
output dims onto one physical stride.  If a coordinate involves a reduction
symbol, the planner skips that coordinate entirely and continues scanning
later device coordinates.  That `continue` behavior is important: a
reduction-controlled outer coordinate must not prevent discovery of a
more-inner output-controlled overflowing coordinate.

Reduction-only input span overflow remains a known limitation.  It requires
reduction-range tiling and partial accumulation, which this pass does not
implement.

## BMM-Specific Symbol Mapping

Batch matmul reductions use `BATCH_MATMUL_OP` and are treated specially when
mapping output symbols:

```text
C[b, m, n] = reduce_k A[b, m, k] * B[b, k, n]
```

`_bmm_output_symbol_to_dim` starts from `_output_symbol_to_dim`, then checks
input dependencies to identify exactly one reduction-only symbol (`k`).  If
there is not exactly one such symbol, it returns `{}` and the BMM input-span
path produces no candidates.

BMM input spans controlled by `b`, `m`, or `n` can be fixed by output-range
tiling.  Spans controlled by `k` are skipped as reduction-range-only.

## Span Calculation

For a physical device coordinate at `device_dim`, span is computed as:

```python
per_core_span = (
    coord_span_elems
    * math.prod(device_size[device_dim + 1:])
    * dtype.itemsize
)
```

This includes the selected physical coordinate and all inner physical
dimensions, including the stick dimension.  It does not include outer physical
dimensions because those choose separate base regions; each outer coordinate is
checked as its own candidate when it varies.

Example:

```text
device_size = [A, B, C, stick]
```

- checking `A`: span is `A * B * C * stick * itemsize`;
- checking `B`: span is `B * C * stick * itemsize`;
- checking `C`: span is `C * stick * itemsize`.

The current planner uses `core_split_estimate=1` for candidate detection and
post-tile validation.  This models the worst case where Work Division provides
no additional help for that coordinate.

## Candidate Collection

Each overflow becomes a `SpanOverflowCandidate` containing a `ChunkingInfo`:

```python
ChunkingInfo(
    total_bytes=...,
    per_core_span=...,
    core_split_estimate=1,
    selected_device_dim_size=...,
    selected_device_span_stride_elems=...,
    selected_host_dim=...,
    stick_elems=...,
    reason="output span overflow" or "input span overflow for arg0",
)
```

Candidates can come from:

- output layout span analysis;
- reduction input span analysis;
- BMM input span analysis.

A single physical coordinate jointly controlled by several output symbols
produces one candidate per contributing host dim, all sharing the same
`per_core_span` (the real joint span of that one coordinate).  Requiring a
dim's own split count from `_candidate_required_split_count` on such a
candidate is a conservative starting estimate -- it assumes that dim alone
must clear the whole joint span -- but it only seeds the bounded divisor
search; the post-tile combo is always validated exactly, so an imprecise
estimate costs extra combo attempts, not correctness.

`_candidate_host_dims` merges candidates by host dim and orders dims by
decreasing span pressure.  This ordering affects the bounded combo search when
costs tie.

## Split Candidates and Cost Search

For each candidate host dim, `_split_candidates_for_host_dim` enumerates legal
split counts from exact divisors of `op.data.ranges[host_dim]`.

A split candidate is legal only if:

- it divides the selected host range exactly;
- it does not cut through physical sticks in the output layout;
- it does not cut through physical sticks in any fixed-layout input dependency
  that is addressed by the same output symbol.

The input-layout stick check matters for BMM/transposed operands.  A split can
look safe on the output layout but misalign an input tensor whose physical stick
dimension maps differently.

The search is bounded:

```python
_MAX_TILE_DIMS = 3
_MAX_SPLITS_PER_DIM = 16
_MAX_TILE_COMBOS = 512
_MAX_AUTO_TILE_SPLIT_COUNT = 64
```

If more than `_MAX_TILE_DIMS` host dimensions overflow, the planner raises
`Unsupported`.  Split candidates per dim are capped before Cartesian product
construction, and automatic split counts above `_MAX_AUTO_TILE_SPLIT_COUNT` are
rejected because current automatic `LoopSpec` lowering can materialize one SDSC
spec per coarse tile.  A plan such as `split_count=769` can therefore generate
`sdsc_0.json` through `sdsc_768.json` instead of one compact symbolic tile loop.
Manual `spyre_hint` remains explicit/user-controlled and can rely on the more
mature user-hint grouping path; the automatic pass is intentionally capped until
auto groups can reuse the same compact grouped lowering.
Combinations are tried in increasing cost order:

```python
cost = (
    product(split_counts),
    number_of_tiled_dims,
    max(split_counts),
    split_counts,
)
```

So the planner prefers fewer total tiles, fewer tiled dimensions, and smaller
maximum split counts.

## Post-Tile Validation

A combo is accepted only after rebuilding the hypothetical per-tile Spyre
layout and re-running span analysis.

```python
tiled_layout = _post_tile_layout_for_splits(
    op.layout,
    split_by_host_dim,
    op.get_name(),
)
```

`_post_tile_layout_for_splits` changes one or more host sizes, recomputes
contiguous host strides, and calls `_resize_device_layout` to rebuild the real
`SpyreTensorLayout` for that tile.

Then `_remaining_span_candidates_after_tile` checks:

- output spans using the rebuilt output layout and output `MemoryDep.ranges`
  shrunk to the hypothetical per-tile domain;
- reduction/BMM input spans using the candidate split map.

Only if no output or relevant input spans remain above `MAX_SPAN_BYTES` does the
planner return a `SpanOverflowTilePlan`.

This is the key safety property: the accepted tile combination is validated
against the same kind of physical layout that coarse tiling will create.

## Multi-Level Plans

The planner can emit multiple output-range tile levels for one op:

```python
SpanOverflowTilePlan(
    levels=(
        SpanOverflowTileLevel(selected_host_dim=0, split_count=2),
        SpanOverflowTileLevel(selected_host_dim=1, split_count=4),
    ),
    ...,
)
```

Levels are emitted outer-to-inner by host dimension.  The adapter creates one
synthetic `DimHint` per level.  `coarse_tile` then stamps a multi-level
`CoarseTileInfo` and scheduler/codegen lower it as nested counted loops.

## Adapter and Coarse Tiling

`coarse_tile.span_overflow_groups(graph)`:

1. skips auto groups if `config.ignore_wsr_hints` or
   `config.ignore_span_overflow_hints` is enabled;
2. skips ops that already have user dim hints;
3. calls `plan_span_overflow_tile`;
4. maps each `selected_host_dim` to a concrete output loop symbol via
   `op_out_coords(op)`;
5. fuses a contiguous run of Pointwise ops into one shared group/loop when
   either (a) each op's own independent plan produces the exact same
   `(host_dim, split_count, is_reduction)` signature as the run so far, or
   (b) an op's own plan disagrees but the op directly reads a buffer written
   by the open run and the run's split is *also* legal and sufficient for
   that op on its own (`can_conform_pointwise_tile`) — the op then adopts the
   run's split instead of its own. Reduction/BMM ops are never grouped or
   used as a conform target in this pass and always get an independent
   singleton group;
6. rejects any op that reads a buffer from an already-closed auto-tiled
   group, from a producer already tiled by a user `spyre_hint` (checked via
   the same `dim_hints` attribute `assign_dim_hints` leaves behind, since
   this pass never clears it), or from the open run without being fusable
   into it (mismatched signature and conform fails, or the reading op is a
   Reduction/BMM), since two independent loop nests over the same
   span-overflow-sized data can desynchronize, and materializing a tiled
   Pointwise producer's full buffer for such an "outside consumer" can
   reintroduce the exact span violation tiling was meant to prevent;
7. creates synthetic `DimHint`s with ids starting at
   `_SPAN_OVERFLOW_HINT_ID = 10000`, shared across every op in a fused group;
8. returns coarse-tile groups in the same format as user hints.

From `coarse_tile` onward, automatic and manual hints share the same path:

- rewrite `op.data.ranges` and `op.layout.size` per tile;
- stamp `CoarseTileInfo`;
- wrap scheduled nodes in `CountedLoopSchedulerNode`;
- emit `LoopSpec` in codegen.

## Configuration

Automatic span-overflow hints are opt-in.  By default:

```python
config.ignore_span_overflow_hints == True
```

because `SPYRE_INDUCTOR_IGNORE_SPAN_OVERFLOW_HINTS` defaults to `1`.  Enable the
pass with:

```bash
SPYRE_INDUCTOR_IGNORE_SPAN_OVERFLOW_HINTS=0
```

The broader working-set-reduction hint switch still suppresses this path:

```python
config.ignore_wsr_hints == True
```

User-authored `spyre_hint` groups take precedence per op.  Automatic hints are
not added to ops that already carry user dim hints.

When span-overflow hints are explicitly enabled, copy-back elision preserves
Pointwise `FixedTiledLayout` producers instead of rewriting them to mutation
layouts.  This mirrors the old large-tensor chunking behavior: enabling the
automatic span-overflow feature opts into keeping pointwise producer layouts
visible to the span planner.  With the default disabled setting, normal
copy-back elision behavior is unchanged.

## Failure Policy

The planner returns `None` for unsupported-but-safe-to-ignore cases such as
ineligible op types, missing output address metadata, failed symbol/coordinate
analysis before any overflow candidate is proven, symbolic layouts, indirect
reads, scalar reductions, or no span overflow.

It raises `Unsupported` when it detects overflow but cannot represent a safe
automatic output-range tile plan.  Common reasons:

- too many overflowing host dims for the bounded search;
- selected host dim is not in `op.data.ranges`;
- selected range is size 1 or non-integral;
- no legal exact divisor exists;
- stick alignment rejects all candidates;
- `_resize_device_layout` cannot reconstruct the post-tile layout;
- every tried combination still leaves output/input spans above the limit;
- an automatically tiled op reads a producer that was already automatically
  tiled, which would require producer-consumer loop fusion to be correct.

These failures are deliberate.  They avoid silently emitting a plan that still
violates the hardware span limit or silently creates unsynchronized tile loops.

## Known Limitations

- Reduction-range tiling is not implemented.  Input spans controlled only by
  reduction symbols are skipped.  If such a skipped span still exceeds the
  hardware limit, downstream Work Division currently logs a critical overflow
  diagnostic but does not raise before backend compilation.
- Scalar/full reductions are skipped.
- Indirect/gather/scatter-style Pointwise and Reduction ops are skipped because
  they require the indirect-access SDSC path.
- The combo search is bounded by `_MAX_TILE_DIMS`, `_MAX_SPLITS_PER_DIM`, and
  `_MAX_TILE_COMBOS`; very high-rank overflow cases can raise `Unsupported`.
- Automatic split counts are additionally capped by
  `_MAX_AUTO_TILE_SPLIT_COUNT`.  This is a lowering/codegen safety limit, not a
  mathematical span limit: current automatic coarse tiling can unroll a large
  tile count into many generated SDSC specs, which is expensive and can appear
  to hang compilation.  For example, an automatic split of `769` may emit 769
  per-tile specs.  Manual `spyre_hint` is still user-controlled and may be able
  to use existing grouped hint lowering more effectively; automatic
  span-overflow should grow producer-consumer/grouped loop lowering before this
  cap is relaxed.
- Reduction auto-tiling rejects splits that shrink the selected output dim's
  per-tile extent to `1`, because the reduction lowering/DDC template path can
  drop unit-size iteration dims before fixed-arity template matching.  This
  restriction is intentionally scoped to Reduction ops; Pointwise full-size
  exact divisors remain legal.
- Symbolic layout metadata is skipped because exact divisibility and post-tile
  Spyre layout validation require concrete sizes.
- A contiguous run of Pointwise ops fuses into one shared loop, either because
  each op's own independent plan already agrees, or because a disagreeing op
  directly reads the run and can legally conform to the run's split
  (`can_conform_pointwise_tile` in `span_overflow_hint_analysis.py`). This is
  still scoped to Pointwise-to-Pointwise: Reduction/BMM ops are never grouped
  and never conform, and fusion never crosses an already-closed group (closed
  groups are, by construction, no longer contiguous with what follows). If a
  Reduction/BMM op reads a producer that was already auto-tiled, or already
  manually tiled by a user `spyre_hint` — or a Pointwise op reads one that it
  cannot conform to — the adapter still raises `Unsupported` instead of
  emitting two independent loop groups. This is required for correctness: a
  restickify/layout-conversion producer and its BMM/LM-head consumer must
  share one synchronized tile loop, and materializing the producer's full
  buffer for such an unfused consumer can reintroduce the exact span
  violation tiling was meant to prevent. A producer and consumer that are
  both inside the same manual `spyre_hint` group are unaffected, since users
  can explicitly group them into one shared coarse-tile group; the conflict
  check only fires when an *automatically*-tiled op reads a manually-hinted
  producer that it was not itself grouped with. Automatic Reduction/BMM
  producer-consumer loop fusion, and fusion across an already-closed group,
  remain future work. A
  typical failure still looks like `Cannot auto-tile buf0: it reads already
  auto-tiled producer(s) ['buf1']` — now for a narrower set of cases (e.g. very
  large `F.linear`/LM-head shapes, where the consumer is a BMM reduction).
- The planner does not yet model expected Work Division splits when choosing
  coarse-tile counts.  Candidate detection uses `core_split_estimate=1`, so
  coarse tiling must make spans safe by itself.  This is conservative and avoids
  depending on a later pass, but it can overestimate the coarse split needed
  when Work Division would already split the same high-pressure coordinate.
  Future cost-model work should validate the combined effect of planned coarse
  tiles plus committed/estimated Work Division splits, so auto coarse tiling only
  covers residual span pressure and avoids excessive `LoopSpec` counts.
- The combo search only considers host dims found by the initial untiled
  candidate scan.  Post-tile validation uses the per-tile output ranges and
  rebuilt physical layout, so it validates the same domain the tiled kernel will
  execute.  Widening the search to absorb new dims discovered only during
  re-validation remains future work if such a case appears.
- Mutation/copy-back intermediate layouts are currently outside planner scope.
  When span-overflow hints are enabled, pointwise copy-back elision preserves
  `FixedTiledLayout` producers so the planner can still see normal pointwise
  producers.  Direct planning through `MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE` remains a
  future eligibility question.
- A coordinate containing a `Mod` atom whose argument is not the bare split
  symbol (e.g. `Mod(3 * h, 64)`, as opposed to `Mod(h, 64)`) is skipped rather
  than bounded: `_coordinate_span_elems` returns `None` for it, since the
  critical-point trick used for bare-symbol `Mod` atoms is not exact once a
  coefficient is applied inside the `Mod`.  No concrete op/lowering path has
  been traced that produces this shape for a `FixedTiledLayout` device
  coordinate today; this is a documented fail-safe boundary rather than a
  known-reachable gap.

## Validation

Main unit/codegen coverage lives in:

```text
tests/inductor/test_span_overflow_hint_analysis.py
```

Run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q torch-spyre/tests/inductor/test_span_overflow_hint_analysis.py
```

Current coverage includes:

- no-op behavior under span limit;
- Pointwise output span tiling;
- Reduction output span tiling;
- Reduction/BMM input span tiling;
- scalar reduction skip;
- indirect-read guards for Pointwise and Reduction;
- reduction-controlled span known limitation;
- BMM reduction-symbol validation;
- input-layout stick alignment, including a symbol that jointly controls an
  input dimension together with another symbol rather than controlling it
  alone;
- multi-level plan generation;
- coordinates jointly controlled by two output symbols producing one candidate
  per contributing dim, on both the output and reduction/BMM input paths;
- Mod-wrapped coordinate span bounds that preserve coefficients around the
  wraparound point, correctly bound a term with multiple `Mod` atoms on the
  same symbol at different moduli, and fail safe (return `None`) for a `Mod`
  whose argument is not the bare symbol;
- post-tile validation using per-tile output ranges;
- adapter and `coarse_tile` stamping;
- fail-safe rejection for the LM-head pattern where an auto-tiled restickify
  producer feeds an auto-tiled BMM consumer;
- codegen `LoopSpec` tests for Pointwise, Reduction, and LM-head restickify
  shapes.
