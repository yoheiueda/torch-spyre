# IBM Spyre device

This document provides an overview of the Spyre device.

## What is Spyre

The Spyre AI Card, also known as the IBM Spyre Accelerator, is a high-performance, energy-efficient
AI accelerator. Currently, it is generally available for IBM Z, LinuxONE, and Power systems.

Spyre Accelerators are engineered to support the development of higher-accuracy AI techniques, enabling real-time generative asset creation, customer data ingestion and interpretation for outreach, cross-selling, and risk assessments.

## Key features

Some of the key features of the Spyre device are listed below:

* It is equipped with 32 AI accelerator cores, capable of handling matrix operations and low‑precision workloads for high throughput.
* It is manufactured using advanced 5nm node technology.
* Each card supports up to 128 GB of LPDDR5 memory, with ensembles of up to eight cards delivering 1 TB memory and massive AI performance.
* It delivers exceptional AI compute, exceeding 300 TOPS per card, while consuming just 75W.
* PCIe gen5 x16 host interface (PCIe form factor card).
* Each core has a 2 MB LX scratchpad (SRAM), shared between the two corelets within the core.
* Each core has a 256 MB limit on the contiguous device-memory span it can address. This is a hardware constraint on the addressable range, distinct from the 2 MB LX scratchpad capacity.

### Core microarchitecture

Each Spyre core is built from two corelets that share a single 2 MB LX scratchpad (SRAM). Inside each corelet there is an 8 × 8 systolic Processing Element (PE) array, used for matrix-style compute on the PT execution unit, plus a 1D Special Function Unit (SFU) for non-linear activations such as GELU and softmax.

Cores talk to each other over a bi-directional ring interconnect at 128 B per cycle per direction. The architecture descends from IBM's research-stage RaPiD AI accelerator (Venkataramani et al., ISCA 2021, [DOI:10.1109/ISCA52012.2021.00021](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCA52012.2021.00021)).

### Memory and tiling constants

The runtime, compiler, and tensor-layout code all share one tiling constant:

```
BYTES_IN_STICK = 128
```

A *stick* is a 128-byte aligned memory chunk, which works out to 64 elements at fp16. The size matches the natural granularity of data transfers between LPDDR5 device memory and the per-core LX scratchpad, so the hardware can pull in a full stick of contiguous elements in a single transfer.

### Production deployments

As of 2025, Spyre is shipping in two production systems. IBM z17 mainframes support up to 48 Spyre cards, each delivering 300+ TOPS (see the [IBM Z press release](https://newsroom.ibm.com/ai-on-z)). IBM Power11 servers run the same silicon as a 75W PCIe gen5 x16 card with 128 GB of LPDDR5 memory (see the [IBM Power11 press release](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-07-08-ibm-power11-raises-the-bar-for-enterprise-it)). The Torch-Spyre integration described in these docs targets that PCIe card configuration.

## Use cases

The Spyre device is designed for enterprise AI workloads including:
* Real-time fraud detection
* Code generation and assistance
* Large language model inference
* Multi-model ensemble inferencing

## Integration with PyTorch

The Spyre device is integrated with PyTorch as a custom backend device, enabling standard PyTorch models to leverage Spyre's AI acceleration capabilities. See the [Getting Started](../getting_started/installation.md) guide for setup and usage instructions. The [examples](../user_guide/examples/index.md) section provides annotated code examples.

IBM and the PyTorch community are collaborating to broaden Spyre's integration into the open-source AI stack, including vLLM and torchtitan.
