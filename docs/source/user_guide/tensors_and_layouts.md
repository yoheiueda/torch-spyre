# Tensor Layouts

Although tensors appear as multidimensional arrays, computer memory is inherently
one-dimensional. A **tensor layout** defines how multidimensional tensor indices
map to positions in linear memory.

PyTorch tensors use _size_ and _stride_ vectors to describe this mapping. However,
these are not sufficient to express the tiled layouts required by the Spyre
architecture. Torch-Spyre therefore introduces Spyre tensor layouts, which extend
the PyTorch representation with additional device-specific structure.

This document complements the
[Tiled Tensor RFC](https://github.com/torch-spyre/rfcs/blob/main/0047-TiledTensors/0047-TiledTensorsRFC.md)
by describing the specific device memory layouts and related APIs used for tensors
in Torch-Spyre.

## Conceptual Overview

```
PyTorch tensor            Spyre tensor layout            Device memory
(size + stride)    →    (device_size + stride_map)   →    (sticks in DDR)
```

PyTorch tensors describe logical tensor structure using size and stride vectors.
Spyre tensor layouts extend this model with additional device dimensions that
represent the tiling and padding required by the hardware.

## PyTorch Tensor Layouts

A PyTorch tensor is a multidimensional array stored in linear memory.

### Rank and Dimensions

The _rank_ of a tensor is the number of dimensions it has. The _dimensions_ of a
PyTorch tensor are indexed by integers in `range(rank)`.

For example, a tensor with shape `(4, 6)` has rank 2, with dim 0 (rows) and
dim 1 (columns).

### Size and Stride

The _size_ vector specifies the number of elements along each dimension. The
_stride_ vector specifies how many memory positions we advance when stepping one
element along a given dimension.

For a tensor with shape `(4, 6)` stored in row-major order:

```
size   = [4, 6]
stride = [6, 1]
```

This means:
- Moving one column (dim 1) advances the memory offset by **1**
- Moving one row (dim 0) advances the memory offset by **6** (one full row)

### Mapping Tensor Coordinates to Memory

The stride vector maps a tuple of tensor coordinates to a linear memory offset:

```
offset = lambda coordinates : np.dot(coordinates, stride)
```

The following example illustrates how this mapping works for a tensor with
shape (4, 6) and stride (6, 1). Each cell shows the linear memory offset for
that coordinate.

The stride vector maps multidimensional indices to a flat address: `offset(i, j) = i × stride[0] + j × stride[1]`. For element (1, 2): offset = 1×6 + 2×1 = 8 (highlighted). stride[0]=6 means stepping one row advances 6 positions in memory; stride[1]=1 means stepping one column advances 1 position.

In PyTorch, the combination of the size vector and stride vector fully determines
how tensor elements are arranged in memory.

## Motivation for Spyre Tensor Layouts

While PyTorch layouts are flexible enough to represent many memory arrangements,
they have a key limitation: a PyTorch tensor has only one stride per dimension and
therefore cannot directly represent tiled memory layouts, which are required for
efficient execution on Spyre.

To address this, Torch-Spyre introduces Spyre tensor layouts with higher ranks than
their PyTorch counterparts. Intuitively, PyTorch tensor dimensions are split into
smaller pieces to construct tiles. These tiles are then arranged into a higher-rank
device tensor layout.

While strides make it possible to express padding in PyTorch tensor layouts,
because Spyre tensor layouts have more dimensions, we need more dimensions of
padding. Therefore, we introduce padded sizes in Spyre tensor layouts maintained
separately from Pytorch sizes. Since PyTorch already maintains sizes, we only
include padded sizes in a Spyre tensor layout. While we could work with strides
instead, we find it easier to reason about padded sizes and order of dimensions
separately rather than combining them into strides.

PyTorch often removes dimensions of size 1 because they do not affect the memory
layout. For instance, `(size=[512, 1, 256], stride=[256, 256, 1])` becomes
`(size=[512, 256], stride=[256, 1])`. After careful consideration we concluded
that dimensions of size 1 must not contribute to the Spyre layout of a tensor.
For this reason, we say a PyTorch tensor layout is in _canonical form_ if it has
no dimension of size 1 and canonicalize PyTorch tensor layouts before reasoning
about them. To be clear, this does not preclude selecting a different layout on
Spyre for a tensor of size `[512, 1]` vs. a tensor of size `[512]` but this will
require explicitly specifying the desired Spyre layout as the default is the same
for both.

A number of operations on Spyre produce _sparse_ tensors, i.e., tensors with a
single element per _stick_. A **stick** is a 128-byte aligned, 128-byte contiguous
block of tensor elements in device memory. The constant `BYTES_IN_STICK = 128` is defined in [`spyre_tensor_impl.cpp`](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/csrc/spyre_tensor_impl.cpp) and used throughout the runtime, compiler, and tensor-layout code. At fp16 it works out to 64 elements per stick. The size lines up with the natural granularity of transfers between LPDDR5 device memory and the per-core LX scratchpad, so the hardware can pull in a full stick of contiguous elements in a single transfer.

In order to describe sparse tensor layouts we permit Spyre tensor layouts to
optionally include a single synthetic dimension that does not correspond to any
dimension of the PyTorch layout. This synthetic inner dimension associated with
a size equal to the maximal number of elements per stick for the tensor data
type will ensure that the sparse tensor has a single element of the
corresponding PyTorch tensor per stick.

### Per-operation stick and padding constraints

Most Spyre operations place constraints on how their operand tensors must
be sticked, and on which dimensions need to be padded to a full stick.
Two common cases:

- **Pointwise (`C = A + B`).** Every operand and the result must share
  the same stick dimension: `stick(A) = stick(B) = stick(C)`. Partial
  sticks are padded out to a full stick (for example, 150 fp16 values
  pad to 192).
- **Matrix multiply (`C[m, n] = A[m, k] @ B[k, n]`).** `A` is sticked on
  the `k` dimension, while `B` and `C` are both sticked on the `n`
  dimension. `B`'s `k` dimension must be padded to full sticks as well,
  and the padded entries on the reduction side have to be set to a
  neutral value (zero) before the op runs so they do not perturb the
  sum.

The compiler enforces these constraints during layout propagation and
inserts `restickify` operations or padding nodes (`insert_padding` in
`CustomPostPasses`) wherever an operand's natural layout would not
satisfy them.

## Spyre Tensor Layouts

A Spyre tensor layout extends the PyTorch layout by introducing additional
dimensions that represent tiling and padding required by the hardware.

The device layout breaks the flat PyTorch tensor into a 2D grid of tiles. *Source: [Tiled Tensor RFC](https://github.com/torch-spyre/rfcs/blob/main/0047-TiledTensors/0047-TiledTensorsRFC.md).*
:::

A Spyre tensor has a Spyre tensor layout in addition to a PyTorch tensor layout.

A Spyre tensor layout consists of a _device\_size_ vector and a _stride\_map_
vector with the same number of elements called _device\_rank_.

The device_rank is always greater than or equal to the rank of the
(canonicalized) PyTorch tensor layout.

In combination with a PyTorch tensor layout, a Spyre tensor layout makes it
possible to represent tiled tensors, sparse tensors, and padded tensors.

In contrast with a PyTorch tensor layout, a Spyre tensor has no explicit stride
vector. A Spyre tensor layout is always in row-major format, i.e., the strides
in the implicit stride vector are always decreasing obtained by formula:

```
stride[i] = math.prod(size[i+1:device_rank])
```

For now, a Spyre tensor layout has a unique _stick dimension_, which is always
dimension device_rank-1. Elements in an 128-byte-aligned 128-byte _stick_ of
tensor data (in a 128-byte-aligned tensor) share the same coordinates for
dimensions 0 to device_rank-2. The device_size of the stick dimension is always
the maximal number of element per stick for the tensor data type.

The stride_map vector maps each device dimension to a host stride: the number
of PyTorch elements to advance in host memory when stepping one position along
that device dimension. The elements of this vector are integers where a value
of `-1` indicates a synthetic or padded dimension with no corresponding host
stride (e.g. the stick dimension when the tensor size is a multiple of the
stick size, or a fully-padded expansion dimension).

For example, for a 3d PyTorch tensor of size `[128, 256, 512]` with
stride `[131072, 512, 1]` and a device_size `[256, 8, 128, 64]`:
- device dim 0 maps to PyTorch dim 1 (stride 512)
- device dim 1 maps to the tile-index part of PyTorch dim 2 (stride 64)
- device dim 2 maps to PyTorch dim 0 (stride 131072)
- device dim 3 maps to the within-stick part of PyTorch dim 2 (stride 1)

The corresponding stride_map is `[512, 64, 131072, 1]`.

The stride_map is used together with device_size to derive DMA loop nests
that transfer elements between host and device memory.

The relationship between PyTorch addressing and device addressing comes
out as a single identity. PyTorch computes a host offset as
`offset = dot(coordinates, stride)`, the device computes its own offset
as `device_offset = dot(device_coordinates, device_stride)`, and the two
are related through:

```
offset = dot(device_coordinates, stride_map)
```

In other words, the stride_map is precisely what lets you walk a tensor
in device-coordinate order and still land on the right host element.

### Why stride_map replaced dim_map

The first version of the Spyre layout took a different approach. It
carried a `dim_map`: a vector that, for each device dimension, named
the index of the PyTorch dimension it came from. For a PyTorch tensor
of shape `[128, 256, 512]` laid out on device as
`device_size = [256, 8, 128, 64]`, the `dim_map` would be
`[1, 2, 0, 2]`. Read from left to right, that says device dim 0 came
from PyTorch dim 1, device dim 1 from PyTorch dim 2 (the tile-index
half of the inner dimension), device dim 2 from PyTorch dim 0, and
device dim 3 from PyTorch dim 2 again (this time the within-stick
half).

That representation reads nicely on slides, but it gets messy in the
cases the Spyre stack handles every day. Padded dimensions are the
first symptom. When the compiler rounds 150 fp16 values up to 192, or
pads B's k-dim to a full stick for a matmul, the device dim no longer
maps cleanly back to a single PyTorch dim. A `dim_map` has to fall
back on a sentinel, and every pass that reads it grows a
"if it's the sentinel, do something else" branch.

Fused and split dimensions are the second symptom. A `flatten`
collapses two PyTorch dims into one; a `reshape` can split one into
two. Tracking that with dim indices means tagging entries with
"this is the upper half of dim 2", and the tag has to survive every
intermediate pass: work division, scratchpad planning, codegen.

Sparse Spyre layouts then add a synthetic inner dimension that has no
corresponding PyTorch dim at all. Yet another sentinel. Views without
copies make the picture even worse: when the compiler implements
`transpose`, `flatten`, or `permute` as a different read pattern over
the same storage, the PyTorch dim indices the view exposes have nothing
to do with the device dims of the underlying buffer, and `dim_map` has
to translate at every boundary.

Strides sidestep all of that. A stride is just an integer count of
"how many host elements to step by", and that number stays meaningful
through padding, splits, fuses, synthetic dims, and views. So the
representation moved to a `stride_map`: one host stride per device
dimension, with `-1` reserved for synthetic or fully-padded dims that
have no host counterpart. Code that walks the device-coordinate space
just dot-products with `stride_map` to recover the host offset, and
the special cases listed above stop needing dedicated code paths.

The compiler team puts it more directly: tensor strides are robust;
tensor dimensions are not.

A worked end-to-end example. The same data shows up two ways: PyTorch sees a 3D tensor of size `[50, 10, 200]`, Spyre stores it as `device_size [10, 4, 50, 64]`. Each `stride_map` entry counts the host elements you advance when you step `+1` along the matching `device_size` dimension, and the identity `offset = dot(device_coordinates, stride_map)` ties the two coordinate systems together.

:::

Dimensions in device_size may be padded. For example a Spyre tensor layout with
stride_map `[512, 64, 131072, 1]` and device_size `[256, 8, 128, 64]` may also
be used for a PyTorch tensor of size `[100, 200, 500]` in which case device
positions that do not map to valid host coordinates represent padding.

## DMA Encoding

To transfer a tensor between host (CPU) memory and device (DDR) memory,
the runtime needs a precise mapping between the two layouts. This mapping
is encoded as three tuples of `N+k` integers, where `N` is the PyTorch
rank and `k` is the number of tiling dimensions:

| Tuple | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **loop ranges** | The size of each loop in the DMA nest |
| **host strides** | Stride in host memory for each loop index |
| **device strides** | Stride in device memory for each loop index |

By convention, tuples are ordered in decreasing device-stride order.

As a concrete example, a 2D row-major `float16` tensor of size `(1024, 256)`:
- Each stick holds 64 `float16` values (128 bytes)
- The 256-element rows tile into 4 sticks
- Host strides: `(256, 1)`; device strides: `(64, 1)` within tiles

The DMA specification for this tensor is:
`((4, 1024, 64), (65536, 64, 1), (64, 256, 1))`, corresponding to:

```
for i in range(4):       # 4 tiles per row
  for j in range(1024):  # 1024 rows
    for k in range(64):  # 64 elements per stick
      device[i*65536 + j*64 + k] = host[j*256 + i*64 + k]
```

These DCI (Data Conversion Information) specs are generated automatically by
the compiler from the `SpyreTensorLayout` stored in `SpyreTensorImpl`.

## Access Patterns

Each Spyre core processes a **tile** — a contiguous slice of device
memory. The compiler divides tensor access across cores in SPMD
(Single Program, Multiple Data) fashion: all cores run the same program
but on different tile ranges identified by their core ID.

Key access pattern properties:
- Sticks belonging to the same tile are **stored contiguously** in
  device memory, so a tile can be staged into the scratchpad as one
  bulk read instead of many scattered ones
- Memory access requests are limited in Spyre, so contiguous stick
  layout is required for full bandwidth utilization
- The work division pass (see
  [Work Division Planning](../compiler/work_division_planning.md))
  determines the tile-to-core assignment

## Default Layouts and Controlling Layouts

Spyre tensors are created using two fundamental PyTorch APIs.
- The `to()` method is used to transfer all elements of an existing
   (host) tensor to a newly allocated device tensor; the result of `to`
   is the device tensor object.
- The `new_empty()`, `new_empty_strided()`, etc. methods are used
   to create an uninitialized device tensor; the result of the method
   is the device tensor object.
Both of these APIs can be invoked either with or without providing an
explicit `SpyreTensorLayout`.  When a `SpyreTensorLayout` is provided, it
specifies precisely how the device tensor will be laid out. When the APIs are
invoked without providing a `SpyreTensorLayout` the device tensor
is created using a default layout. Conceptually the default layout
(a) designates the last dimension as the stick dimension, (b) tiles
along the first dimension, and (c) pads the size of the stick dimension
to make it evenly divisible into sticks.

### Default Layout Example
The layout metadata is encoded by the runtime C++ class `SpyreTensorLayout` (see [spyre_tensor_impl.h](https://github.com/torch-spyre/torch-spyre/blob/main/torch_spyre/csrc/spyre_tensor_impl.h)).
An instance of this class is embedded as a field in the `SpyreTensorImpl` class.
It can be accessed in Python via an added Tensor method `device_tensor_layout()`.
The key elements of metadata are:
- `device_size`: analogous to PyTorch's `size` but with padded values and extra dimensions for tiling.
- `stride_map`: a vector of the same length as `device_size` giving the host stride for each device dimension (-1 for synthetic or padded dimensions).
- `device_dtype`: the datatype of the Tensor.
- `element_arrangement`: how elements are packed within a stick. Defaults to `STANDARD` and appears in the `repr` only when it is non-standard.

As a concrete example, run the following program:

```
import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 100, 150, dtype=torch.float16)
y = x.to("spyre")
stl = y.device_tensor_layout()
print(stl)
```

You should see something like:

```
SpyreTensorLayout(device_size=[100, 3, 5, 64], stride_map =[150, 64, 15000, 1], device_dtype=DataFormats.SEN169_FP16)
```

The 3-D tensor has a 4-D `device_size`.
A float16 is two bytes, therefore each stick contains 64 data values.
The stick dimension of `150` has been padded to `192` and broken into two device dimensions of (`3` and `64`).

### Specifiying Alternate Layouts

The minimal constructor for a `SpyreTensorLayout` takes a `size` and `dtype` and
builds a instance that encodes the default layout.  This constructor
is what is used behind the scenes when the user does not specify a layout.

As an example, we can explictly request the default layout in a `to` by doing:

```
import torch
from torch_spyre._C import SpyreTensorLayout
x = torch.rand(5, 100, 150, dtype=torch.float16)
stl = SpyreTensorLayout((5, 100, 150), torch.float16)
y = x.to("spyre",device_layout=stl)
print(y.device_tensor_layout())
```

You should see exactly the same output as before:

```
SpyreTensorLayout(device_size=[100, 3, 5, 64], stride_map =[150, 64, 15000, 1], device_dtype=DataFormats.SEN169_FP16)
```

A second constructor of `SpyreTensorLayout` enables finer-grained control.
It takes the explicit `host_strides` and an additional `dim_order`, allowing
the programmer to fine-tune the layout based on their knowledge of how the
Tensor will be used in computation. (The minimal constructor computes the
default contiguous strides for you; this one requires them explicitly.)

For example, changing the constructor in the above program to

```
stl = SpyreTensorLayout((5, 100, 150), (15000, 150, 1), torch.float16, [1,0,2])
```

yields a tensor with the tiling inverted:

```
SpyreTensorLayout(device_size=[5, 3, 100, 64], stride_map =[15000, 64, 150, 1], device_dtype=DataFormats.SEN169_FP16)
```

## Layout Compatibility

Spyre operations impose **hard constraints** on the memory layout of
their inputs and outputs. The compiler enforces these during the
stickification pass:

- Operations such as dot product require both inputs to have **identical
  memory layouts**.
- Reduction operations along the stick dimension produce **sparse
  tensors** — outputs containing a single element per stick.
- The compiler performs a topological traversal of the scheduler graph,
  propagating layout constraints from inputs outward and raising a
  compile-time error if an infeasible layout is detected.

Layouts for computed tensors (`ComputedBuffers`) are derived via
`FixedTiledLayout` — a Torch-Spyre extension to Inductor's
`FixedLayout` that adds a `device_layout` field containing the
`SpyreTensorLayout`. This allows Inductor's memory planner and code
generator to use accurate on-device sizes when allocating intermediate
buffers and generating host code.

The stickification pass inserts `restickify` operations where needed to
reconcile incompatible layouts between adjacent operations.

## Generating DCIs and SuperDSCs

For each `torch.compile`d function, the front-end compiler generates:

1. **DCI (Data Conversion Information)** — host-side descriptors for DMA transfers that
   move tensor tiles between host memory and device DDR. These are
   derived directly from the `SpyreTensorLayout` of each graph input
   and output.

2. **SuperDSC JSON** — the per-kernel specification passed to the
   DeepTools back-end compiler. Each SuperDSC encodes the op name,
   input/output tensor layouts (device sizes, stride maps, dtypes), work
   division, and scratchpad allocations.

The code generator uses `FixedTiledLayout` to determine accurate device
tensor sizes for memory allocation calls in the host code, and to
generate optimized kernel loop nests that match the device's tiled
access pattern.
