Upstream PyTorch decorator patchers for the OOT test framework.

These patchers modify upstream PyTorch test decorators at instantiation time
to allow the registered privateuse1 backend to run tests that would otherwise
be restricted to specific devices or dtypes.

Each patcher follows the same pattern:
  1. Receive the test method as passed to instantiate_test()
  2. Locate the upstream decorator instance (in the closure or on the function)
  3. Mutate its configuration in-place so the decorator allows privateuse1

PyTorch decorators like @onlyOn and @ops read their configuration at call
time, not at decoration time. So mutating the decorator instance after
decoration but before the test runs is sufficient.

PyTorch deepcopies the test method before calling instantiate_test(), so
each call has its own fresh decorator instances. A one-time global patch
would not affect these copies.
