        During the first matmul, we need buffers of total size N x D x (G + 1 + S); then when
        computing numerators, we need buffers of total size N x (2 x D x S + G); same when computing
        scores; and to compute output, we need N x D x (G + 1 + S) again. We choose the parameters
        so that both N x D x (G + 1 + S) and N x (2 x D x S + G) fit into LX, but only just.

        """This pattern is a (simplified) mixture of experts multi-layer perceptron.

        We start with a hidden state, of dimension batch x seq_len x hidden_size. We matmul with a
        selector matrix (of dimension hidden_size x num_experts) to obtain qualities of dimension
        batch x seq_len x num_experts, indicating the quality of each expert for each token. We find
        the top k indices for each subtensor in the last dimension (an integer tensor of dimension
        batch x seq_len x k). We create a masked version of quality of the same dimension (replacing
        the non-selected entries by -inf). We apply softmax to this to get the weights - we pretend
        here that softmax is simply a pointwise operation.

        We now determine the tokens for each expert from the top k indices. This is an integer
        tensor of dimension num_experts x (batch * seq_len * 2), giving for each expert the batch
        and seq_len index for each token that they need to process; there are at most batch *
        seq_len such indices for any one expert.

        Now, for each expert, we collect the n_tokens x hidden_size matrix of selected_tokens from
        the hidden state (where n_tokens <= batch * seq_len), compute up = selected_tokens @ M1 +
        bias_1 and gate = selected_tokens @ M2 + bias_2 where M1 and M2 are (expert-dependent)
        matrices of dimension hidden_size x mlp_size and bias_1 and bias_2 are (expert-dependent)
        vectors of dimension mlp_size. We define out = up * silu(gate), and down = out @ M3 +
        bias_3, where M3 is an (expert-dependent) mlp_size x hidden_size matrix and bias_3 is an
        (expert-dependent) hidden_size vector. Now we add the entries of out to the appropriate
        entries of hidden state, scaled by the appropriate weight. After all experts are done, we
        save the hidden state to HBM.

        We assume that both integers and floats are 16 bits. This means that there are at most 65536
        experts and that batch_size and seq_len are at most 32768, assuming we want to use -1 as a
        special value in tokens_per_expert.
