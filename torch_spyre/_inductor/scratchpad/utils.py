    An LX-pinned buffer is addressed by a single base (in SDSC codegen the
    ``start_address`` is ``layout.allocation["lx"]``); unlike the HBM path, a
    per-access slice offset is *not* folded into that base, and strided
    partial reads of a multi-dim buffer mis-address. Both failure modes read
    less than the full buffer per access:

    - multi-offset: ``x[:, 0:512] + x[:, 512:1024]`` — two half reads that
      both resolve to the LX base, yielding ``x0 + x0``;
    - partial slice: ``x[:, :, 0:64]`` — a sub-extent read that mis-addresses
      the 3D LX buffer.

    Only buffers every consumer reads in full (e.g. ``exp(x) + x``) are safe
    to LX-pin. We are deliberately conservative: an unprovable (symbolic)
    footprint is treated as unsafe, costing a missed optimization but never
    correctness.

    Why a guard and not a codegen fix: the root cause is that the SDSC LX
    address path (compute_ops._start_addr_data) uses only ``start_address``,
    dropping the per-access view offset that the HBM path folds in via
    ``core_idx_to_slice_offset``. It is a codegen gap, not a hardware limit.
    But folding ``sum(offsets)`` into the LX base only fixes part of it: the
    view offset interacts with per-core work-slicing (at multi-core the split
    changes which coordinate is constant vs per-core), so a correct fix must
    reconcile the view offset with the per-core LX work-slice geometry rather
    than add a single constant. Until that lands, the guard keeps such buffers

    write's codegen assumes the target buffer keeps the slicing the eager path
    chose; if the co-optimizing allocator re-slices any op in that fused kernel
    (a different core division), the deeptools scheduler can no longer place the

    The caller pins every op in this set to its upstream (fixed) division, so
