    """Convert plain ``LifetimeBoundBuffer``s to ``CoreDivisionBuffer``s for
    solvers that require the richer type (e.g. :class:`CpSatLayoutSolver`).

    ``CoreDivisionBuffer`` subclasses ``LifetimeBoundBuffer`` and the placement
    solvers read only the base fields, so any solver can consume the result (LSP):
    the caller always converts, regardless of which solver is configured. To stay
    correct across both worlds -- the placement solvers use ``size`` directly as
    the footprint, while ``CpSatLayoutSolver`` divides it by the chosen division's
    ``output_partition`` -- ``size`` stays the already-per-core footprint
    (``_build_bound_buffers`` divided by the op's pre-determined core division) and
    each buffer gets a single *trivial* ``CoreDivision`` (empty splits,
    ``output_partition == 1``). With one candidate the solver cannot re-divide the
    buffer: it loses the joint core-division optimization path and merely *places*
    the buffer on its fixed, pre-determined division (placement-only CP-SAT).

    ``parents`` is populated with each op's read deps that are themselves
    candidates, because CP-SAT scores residency per producer->consumer edge and
    gates it on a slicing-compatible division: a buffer with no children, or any
    child lacking a compatible pair, can never reside (see
    ``_implicate_core_division``). Although each buffer's stored ``CoreDivision``
    is trivial (for sizing, above), the match pairs are derived from the two ops'
    *fixed* divisions (``op.op_it_space_splits``, read via ``_per_core_view_on_buf``
    -- independent of the stored trivial ``CoreDivision``). Unlike the old
    conversion -- which asserted every edge compatible with a blanket ``[(0, 0)]``
    pair -- the pair is ``[(0, 0)]`` only when the producer's write-view and the
    consumer's read-view slice the shared buffer identically (same per-core view,
    same core count, no partial reduction). When the fixed divisions disagree --
    which they may, since the upstream passes size each op independently -- the
    edge gets an **empty** match list, so the producer falls back to HBM across it
    (always correct) instead of being wrongly pinned to a slicing its consumer
    does not read. An input parent (no producing op) keeps ``[(0, 0)]``: its clone
    is laid out to match its consumer.

    Reads by consumers that are *not* candidates -- ops filtered out of the LX
    set, or graph outputs -- are counted in ``unallocated_reads`` instead: they
    still read the buffer from LX when it resides (no output cloning needed for
    an intermediate), so they justify pinning it even though no ``parents`` edge
    represents them. This matches the greedy allocator, which pins any buffer
    read more than once regardless of where its consumers live. Buffers that are
    already ``CoreDivisionBuffer``s (e.g. from the joint allocator) pass through
    unchanged.
