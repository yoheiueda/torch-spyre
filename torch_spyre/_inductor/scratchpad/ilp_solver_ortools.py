"""Joint core-division + LX-placement solver built on OR-Tools CP-SAT
(``config.layout_solver == "cpsat"``).

Selects each buffer's core division and its LX scratchpad placement in one
constraint model over :class:`CoreDivisionBuffer`s:

* **Joint core-division.** ``size`` is the *total* device footprint; a ``div``
  var indexes the buffer's candidate divisions (from
  ``enumerate_work_division_candidates``) and ``AddElement`` ties the chosen
  index to the per-core footprint (``eff_size = size / output_partition``) and
  total core usage (``cores = cores_used``, including any reduction-axis split).
* **Slicing-match residency gate.** A resident buffer's division must induce the
  same per-core slicing as *every* consumer's, using the precomputed
  ``cd_parent_matches`` pairs over the ``parents`` (producer/consumer) edges; a
  buffer with no consumer, or a consumer with no compatible pair, can never
  reside (``_implicate_core_division``).
* **Placement** is a global ``AddNoOverlap2D`` over optional rectangles
  (``[start_time, end_time) x [offset, offset + eff_size)``, present iff
  resident). In-place reuse (``in_place_parents`` -> per-edge ``merge_vars``) is
  encoded by *shortening the parent's lifetime* by the single handoff tick when
  the merge fires, so the parent and its in-place child abut in time and may
  legally share an offset; the single-tick-overlap invariant
  (``_assert_in_place_relationships``) makes this exact (``_add_no_overlap_2d``).
* **Objective** (two-phase lexicographic, in ``_run``). *Residency is the hard
  priority.* Phase 1 minimizes total **HBM transfer traffic** -- spilling a
  buffer forces each consumer to re-read it from HBM, so a spill costs
  ``num_consumers * size`` -- putting as much in LX as possible and choosing
  whatever division serves that (even no split, if that is what lets a buffer
  match its consumers and reside). Phase 2 then *holds that residency optimum*
  and maximizes total core usage (``sum_b cores_b``) so every buffer -- resident
  or spilled, the latter free of the slicing gate -- takes its most parallel
  division, which the allocator commits. Parallelism never costs a spill.

After the solve, ``_justify`` slides each in-place-merged placement unit down to
the lowest free address, squeezing out float gaps without raising the peak.
