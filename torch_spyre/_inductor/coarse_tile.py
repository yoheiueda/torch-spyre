"""Coarse-tiling IR pass: stamp loop_group_id / loop_count on ir.Operation objects.

Each group of operations is wrapped in one or more nested counted loops.  For
every operation in the group the iteration ranges divided by each loop's trip
count are scaled down by that factor; the resulting (smaller) per-iteration
ranges are what the downstream scheduler and work-division passes will see.

A ``loop_group_id`` tuple encodes the nesting path:
  - ``(g,)``       — outermost loop group with index ``g``
  - ``(g, h)``     — inner loop group ``h`` nested inside outer group ``g``
  - etc.

``loop_count`` is a *list* of trip counts, one per nesting level from outermost
to innermost.  For a single-level group this is a 1-element list ``[K]``.
``loop_tiled_dims`` is a *list of lists*, one sub-list per nesting level.

Entry point::

    groups = hints_to_coarse_tile_groups(graph)
    coarse_tile(graph, groups)

``groups`` is a list of ``(ops, levels)`` tuples where ``levels`` is a list of
``(hint_id, count, is_reduction_level)`` triples, outermost first.  Each op
resolves its own tiled dimension from its ``loop_var`` in ``dim_hints``.

Each ``ops`` list must be a contiguous sub-sequence of ``operations``.

After stamping, ``coarse_tile`` calls ``insert_tiling_propagation`` to allocate
full-sized output buffers and insert copy/mutation ops for Pointwise operations
whose results are consumed outside the loop.

    This pass attempts to move each such op either just before the run it
    splits or just after the last same-key op in the remainder, so the run
    becomes contiguous.

    Algorithm — two-cursor scan over ops:

    Outer cursor i: start of the next candidate run.  Advances to j when
    the inner loop exits.

    Inner cursor j: walks forward from i+1 building the run.  For each
    op at ops[j]:
      - Same hint key → absorb into run; j += 1.
      - Non-ComputedBuffer or differently-hinted → hard stop; break.
      - Unhinted ComputedBuffer (interloper) → one of three outcomes:
          (a) Move before: insert at run_start, run_start += 1, j stays
              (the rotate shifts subsequent ops left so ops[j] is fresh).
          (b) Move after: pop(j), insert at run_end-1, j stays.
          (c) Neither legal → RuntimeError.
        run_end is the index one past the *last* same-key op in ops[j+1:],
        found by scanning backward.  Using the last op (not just the next)
        ensures the move-after target span covers the full remaining run,
        which matters when interlopers further right would otherwise still
        split the run.

    When the inner loop exits, j points to the first op that could not be
    absorbed — a hard-stop or end-of-list.  Advancing i to j (not i+1)
    is correct because everything before j has already been processed.

    A move is legal when it introduces no new data-flow violation:
    no op in the skipped range reads or mutates the moved op's written
    buffers, and the moved op reads or mutates no buffer written in the
    skipped range.

    When both directions are legal the op is moved before the run (closer
    to its original position).

    Raises RuntimeError if an interloper cannot be moved in either
    direction (data-flow dependencies anchor it between hinted ops that
    share the same hint key).

    Used in two directions:

    * **shrink** (``_divide_ranges``): the buffer is the same physical
      allocation; coarse tiling narrows the per-tile iteration range.
      ``device_size`` entries for non-stick dims shrink to reflect the smaller
      per-tile extents.
    * **grow** (``_allocate_full_buffer``): a full-sized scatter-target buffer
      is allocated to match a per-tile source.  ``device_size`` entries grow
      back to the full extent.  The stick orientation (transposed vs row-major,
      ``element_arrangement``) is propagated verbatim so both buffers agree on
      physical layout and scatter-copy address arithmetic is correct.

    ``stride_map`` semantics: a value of ``-1`` means "this device dimension has
    extent 1 and is never stepped through; its stride is undefined."  When
    growing back from a singleton (``orig_sm[j] == -1``), the stride is
    recomputed from the new host stride (the rescue arm in Passes 2–4).  For
    non-contiguous (transposed / col-major) dims, the *physical* stride on
    device is invariant to resizing, so it is left unchanged.

    Device-dim classification (as produced by ``get_generic_stick_layout``):

    * **inner stick** (always ``j == ndev-1``) — ``device_size`` is always
      ``elems_per_stick``; left unchanged.  ``stride_map`` updated only if the
      stick host dim is contiguous or was a singleton.
    * **non-stick dim** — one device dim per non-stick host dim.  Matched to
      host dim ``p`` by size (``device_size[j] == old_host_size[p]``), with
      ``stride_map[j]`` used as a tiebreaker when two host dims share the same
      size.  ``device_size`` updated to ``new_host_size[p]``.  ``stride_map``
      updated iff ``orig_sm[j] == old_hs[p]`` (contiguous) or ``== -1``
      (was a singleton being grown).
    * **stick tile-count** — ``ceil(old_host_size[p*] / eps)`` device elements
      spanning the stick host dim ``p*``.  Updated to
      ``ceil(new_host_size[p*] / eps)``.  Same stride-update rule as non-stick.
    * **singleton** (``device_size == 1, stride_map == -1``) — either a sparse
      placeholder (no corresponding host dim) or a non-stick dim tiled to
      extent 1.  Left as-is when there is no host dim to match; matched by
      size-1 to a host dim of size 1 when one exists (grow path from singleton).

    ``p*`` (the stick host dim) is identified by elimination: the unique host
    dim *not* matched as a non-stick dim.  When a reduction collapses the stick
    axis, all host dims are matched as non-stick and ``pstar`` is ``None``; in
    that case Passes 3 and 4 are skipped (tile-count and inner-stick entries are
    frozen at their collapsed values).

    Multi-pass algorithm:

    * **Pass 1**: match non-inner-stick device dims to host dims by size.
      Size-1 dims match only to host dims of size 1.  Size > 1 dims match by
      ``device_size == old_host_size[p]``, with stride as tiebreaker when sizes
      collide.  Unmatched dims are candidates for tile-count.
    * **Pass 1b**: fix tile-count / size collisions.  When
      ``ceil(old_host_size[p*] / eps) == old_host_size[q]`` for some non-stick
      dim ``q``, the tile-count dim and dim ``q`` have the same size and Pass 1
      may have provisionally claimed the tile-count dim as a non-stick dim.
      Pass 1b corrects this after ``p*`` is provisionally known: a provisional
      match is reclassified as tile-count when its stride also mismatches the
      expected contiguous non-stick stride.
    * **Pass 2**: update non-stick dims (``matched_host``).
    * **Pass 3**: validate and update tile-count dims (``unmatched_j``).
    * **Pass 4**: update inner stick (``j == ndev-1``).

    ``device_dtype`` and ``element_arrangement`` are copied verbatim from
    ``orig_stl``, preserving EXX2/QFP8/DL16 layouts.

    Raises ``RuntimeError`` if any non-stick device dim matches ambiguously, or
    if the stick host dim cannot be uniquely determined by elimination.
