"""Coarse-tiling IR pass: stamp loop_group_id / loop_count on ir.Operation objects.

Each group of operations is wrapped in one or more nested counted loops.  For
every operation in the group the iteration ranges divided by each loop's trip
count are scaled down by that factor; the resulting (smaller) per-iteration
ranges are what the downstream scheduler and work-division passes will see.

A ``loop_group_id`` tuple encodes the nesting path:
  - ``(g,)``       — outermost loop group with index ``g``
  - ``(g, h)``     — inner loop group ``h`` nested inside outer group ``g``
  - etc.

``loop_count`` is a *list* of trip counts, one per nesting level from outermost
to innermost.  For a single-level group this is a 1-element list ``[K]``.
``loop_tiled_dims`` is a *list of lists*, one sub-list per nesting level.

Entry point::

    groups = hints_to_coarse_tile_groups(graph)
    coarse_tile(graph, groups)

``groups`` is a list of ``(ops, levels)`` tuples where ``levels`` is a list of
``(hint_id, count)`` pairs, outermost first.  Each op resolves its own
tiled dimension from its ``loop_var`` in ``dim_hints``.

Each ``ops`` list must be a contiguous sub-sequence of ``operations``.

After stamping, ``coarse_tile`` calls ``insert_tiling_propagation`` to allocate
full-sized output buffers and insert copy/mutation ops for Pointwise operations
whose results are consumed outside the loop.

    This pass attempts to move each such op either just before the run it
    splits or just after the last same-key op in the remainder, so the run
    becomes contiguous.

    Algorithm — two-cursor scan over ops:

    Outer cursor i: start of the next candidate run.  Advances to j when
    the inner loop exits.

    Inner cursor j: walks forward from i+1 building the run.  For each
    op at ops[j]:
      - Same hint key → absorb into run; j += 1.
      - Non-ComputedBuffer or differently-hinted → hard stop; break.
      - Unhinted ComputedBuffer (interloper) → one of three outcomes:
          (a) Move before: insert at run_start, run_start += 1, j stays
              (the rotate shifts subsequent ops left so ops[j] is fresh).
          (b) Move after: pop(j), insert at run_end-1, j stays.
          (c) Neither legal → RuntimeError.
        run_end is the index one past the *last* same-key op in ops[j+1:],
        found by scanning backward.  Using the last op (not just the next)
        ensures the move-after target span covers the full remaining run,
        which matters when interlopers further right would otherwise still
        split the run.

    When the inner loop exits, j points to the first op that could not be
    absorbed — a hard-stop or end-of-list.  Advancing i to j (not i+1)
    is correct because everything before j has already been processed.

    A move is legal when it introduces no new data-flow violation:
    no op in the skipped range reads or mutates the moved op's written
    buffers, and the moved op reads or mutates no buffer written in the
    skipped range.

    When both directions are legal the op is moved before the run (closer
    to its original position).

    Raises RuntimeError if an interloper cannot be moved in either

    share the same hint key).

    """Build coarse_tile() groups from automatic span-overflow plans.

    This adapter converts SpanOverflowTilePlans into the same group shape as
    user spyre_hint annotations: ``[(ops, [(hint_id, count)])]``.  Ops that
    already carry user dim hints are left for the user-hint grouping path.
    ``is_reduction`` is not carried in the group-level ``levels`` list; it
    lives on each op's own ``DimHint`` and is consulted directly by
    ``_stamp_group``.

    A contiguous run of Pointwise ops shares one group/loop when either:
      - each op's own independently-searched plan
        (``plan_span_overflow_tile``) produces the exact same
        ``(host_dim, split_count, is_reduction)`` signature as the run so
        far; or
      - an op's own plan disagrees, but the run reads into it (a real
        producer-consumer edge) and the run's existing split is *also* a
        legal, sufficient plan for that op on its own
        (``can_conform_pointwise_tile``) — the op then adopts the run's split
        instead of its own.

    Reduction/BMM ops are never grouped (this pass is Pointwise-only for now)
    and always get an independent singleton group. An op that reads a buffer
    from an already-closed group, or from the open run without being
    fusable into it, still raises ``Unsupported``: two independent loop nests
    over the same span-overflow-sized data can desynchronize, and for ops
    tiled specifically because their *full* buffer violates the hardware
    span limit, falling back to materializing that full buffer for an
    "outside consumer" would silently reintroduce the exact span violation
    tiling was meant to prevent.

    This is the same identity mechanism ``_pick_stick_dim`` uses to choose a
    stick dim, so it is as reliable as the existing stick logic.  Returns
    ``None`` when identity cannot be resolved (single-symbol match not unique),
    so the caller falls back to size-based inference.

    The stick host dim is invariant under coarse tiling (tiling shrinks a range
