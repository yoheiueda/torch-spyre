"""Loop unrolling for coarse-tiling LoopSpec trees.

When ``bundle_hbm_symbols=False`` the backend compiler does not support
``scf.for`` loops in ``bundle.mlir``.  This module provides
``unroll_loop_specs``, which fully unrolls a ``list[OpSpec | LoopSpec]`` tree
into a flat list of ``OpSpec`` entries with concrete per-iteration addresses
baked into each ``TensorArg.allocation``.

Whether a tensor's address advances per iteration is determined solely by
``TensorArg.per_tile_fixed`` (set by ``insert_tiling_propagation``'s use-def
analysis):

- ``per_tile_fixed=True``: tile-local scratch reused every iteration — fixed.
- ``per_tile_fixed=False``: address advances per iteration regardless of
  allocation type (hbm, pool, or lx).

After unrolling, ``tiled_symbols`` is cleared on every copy so
``generate_bundle`` treats the ops as plain non-tiled entries.

Nested ``LoopSpec`` nodes (e.g. outer K=2 / inner M=4) are unrolled
innermost-first, yielding K×M flat copies with correct combined addresses.
