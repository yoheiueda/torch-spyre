"""IR-level pass to pad y's K (row) dimension to a stick boundary for
BATCH_MATMUL_OP operations.  Runs in CustomPreSchedulingPasses immediately
after insert_restickify, when every ComputedBuffer has a FixedTiledLayout.

Only y is padded; x is left untouched.

For y, the following IR sequence is emitted:
  1. ComputedBuffer - output buffer allocation (FixedLayout)
  2. SpyreConstantFallback - fill constant (FixedLayout)
  3. ComputedBuffer - fill padding region (MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE)
  4. ComputedBuffer - copy input data (MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE)

y's padded buffer is built at the full K_padded host size by lower_pad_sequence.
reduction_ranges stays at K; the K→K_padded extension happens at SDSC codegen
time: _extend_matmul_k_to_padded in superdsc.py reads K_padded from y's
device_size and widens sdsc_iteration_space[K] to K_padded before
_create_sdsc_tensors runs.

x is left physically untouched.  The hardware masks within-stick elements of x
beyond the true K to zero, so extending the SDSC iteration to K_padded does not
introduce numerical error from x.

Deduplication of identical constants across multiple pad calls happens later
at the IR level via dedup_and_promote_constants.

x and y are identified via identify_matmul_inputs() using the BatchMatmul
generated_dim definition: y is the input whose index contains a symbol
present in the output but absent from x (N).  This handles M==K==N and
M=1 (decode phase) correctly.
