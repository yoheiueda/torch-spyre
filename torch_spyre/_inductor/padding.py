"""IR-level pass to pad y's K (row) dimension to a stick boundary for
BATCH_MATMUL_OP operations.  Runs in CustomPreSchedulingPasses immediately
after insert_restickify, when every ComputedBuffer has a FixedTiledLayout.

Only y is padded; x is left untouched.

For y, the following IR sequence is emitted:
  1. ComputedBuffer - output buffer allocation (FixedLayout)
  2. SpyreConstantFallback - fill constant (FixedLayout)
  3. ComputedBuffer - fill padding region (MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE)
  4. ComputedBuffer - copy input data (MutationLayoutSHOULDREMOVE)

y's padded buffer is built at the full K_padded host size by lower_pad_sequence.
reduction_ranges stays at K; the K→K_padded extension happens at SDSC codegen
time: _extend_matmul_k_to_padded in superdsc.py reads K_padded from y's
device_size and widens sdsc_iteration_space[K] to K_padded before
_create_sdsc_tensors runs.

x is left physically untouched.  The hardware masks within-stick elements of x
beyond the true K to zero, so extending the SDSC iteration to K_padded does not
introduce numerical error from x.

Deduplication of identical constants across multiple pad calls happens later
at the IR level via dedup_and_promote_constants.

x and y are identified via device_coordinates: x is the input sticked on the
reduction coord, y is the other.  This avoids positional assumptions and handles
square matrices (M==K==N) correctly.
